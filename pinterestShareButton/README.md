# Pinterest Share Button *- for the Mono Editor*
Adds a Pinterest share button , which sends a "pin it" request to Pinterest with current URL. Works only on blog posts as these have share buttons by default.

## Usage
Add this line in `Body tag (Global HTML)` in the *Site settings*.
```html
<script src="#"></script>
```
If share buttons are disabled on posts, it will throw an error. If this is the case, there is no need for this script.
